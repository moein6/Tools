This Header files makes My coding a little easier and i can have a faster coding.

They have some features which will be described one-by-one

1 - Array : 
  1 - you can simply call Print() function.
  2 - operator >>:  you can Input all of the elements to your array.
  3 - Unique_initialaze():  it will randomly initialize your array with no repited elements.
  4 - Unique_Unique_initialaze(): randomly initializes your array but you can choose how many digits each element has.
  5 - Random_initialaze(): Simply initialaze your array.
  
  
  
2 - Screan :
  1 - Operator << : Show your text.
  2 - operator == : shows you massages.
  3 - operator || : shows your Error texts.
  4 - Input(): It will recevie the inputs and if there is a wrong input then your program will not crash.
  
  
  
3 - File :
  1 - Constructor : it will open file in contidion that you choose and there is no need to be check if file exist.
  2 - operator <<: it saved data in file in non-binary mode.
  3 - operator >>: it reads data and put it in opbject.
  4 - operator <<= : this operator is write to save data in binary mode in specific location of file but this is specialy for classes that 
      have a function called Get_ID() and that return the location.
  5 - operator <<= : this operator is doing the same as number 4 but in this case the object that have no Get_ID() function can be in a 
      pair wich the pair contains the object data and the location in file.
  6 - operator >>= : reads data of a specific location of file and the location will be clearify by Get_ID90 function.
  7 - operator >>= : this contains a std::pair that the object does not have a Get_ID() function and the pair contains the location of
      data in file.
      


these are cool stuff that i made in my free times and i have used them in some projects and helped! 
hope it will hwlp you too.
